## Introduction

This project is a tool for Unity's 2D workspace that allows users
to create procedurally generated levels in the editor. It accepts a preset
that will define the style of the level and then generates it and places tiles
in the scene.

## Using the tool

To use the tool, simply attach the script to an empty object, configure the settings how you like, and hit the generate button at the bottom.
You can create your own preset or use one of the three already provided.
